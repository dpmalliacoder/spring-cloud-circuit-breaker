# Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker pattern
Circuit Breaker pattern in Spring Boot is a design pattern used to prevent cascading failures in a microservices 
architecture. It functions by detecting when a service is unresponsive or experiencing issues and then preventing 
further calls to that service, thereby protecting the overall system's stability.

- **Closed State**:
The circuit breaker allows requests to pass through to the target service. It monitors the success and failure rates of these calls.
- **Open State**:
If the failure rate exceeds a predefined threshold, the circuit "trips" and enters the open state. In this state, 
all subsequent calls to the target service are immediately rejected, and a fallback method is executed instead. 
This prevents further calls to the failing service and allows it time to recover.
- **Half-Open State:**
After a configurable waitDurationInOpenState, the circuit breaker transitions to a half-open state. In this state, 
a limited number of test calls are allowed to pass through to the target service.
  - If these test calls succeed, the circuit returns to the closed state, indicating the service has recovered.
  - If the test calls fail, the circuit returns to the open state, and the waiting period restarts.

# Integrate Prometheus and Grafana Dashboard
can also have these metrics collected by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana. 
To demonstrate this, the repo contains a Docker Compose file that will start Prometheus and Grafana locally and 
scrape the metrics being surfaces at /actuator/prometheus.

![Class Diagram](diagrams/grafana.png)

- Run docker-compose up
  - Go to http://localhost:3000 and login with the username admin and the password admin
  There will be a datasource pointing to the docker container running Prometheus and dashboard already 
  configured to visualize the Resilience4J metrics
- Prometheus metrics
  - curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/actuator/prometheus
